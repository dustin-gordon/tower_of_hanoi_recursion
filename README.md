# tower_of_hanoi_recursion
Recursive implementation to solve the "Tower of Hanoi" problem.

Explanation of the Tower of Hanoi problem: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cburch/survey/recurse/hanoi.html

The program runs as follows:
- The user is prompted to enter a number of disks to add to the first "tower."
- The program prints a line of text indicating the movement of disks, which are indexed starting at 0. 
- The moveTower() function is called recursively until the problem is solved (disks moved from peg A to C in proper order).
- Display the number of moves performed to demonstrate effectiveness of recursion for this problem.
